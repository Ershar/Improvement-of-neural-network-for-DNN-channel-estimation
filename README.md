This is a brief improvement on DNN channel estimation to achieve better estimation accuracy.
The optimization includes the addition of a self-attention mechanism and regularization measures. 
Here, only the TensorFlow-based neural network model is provided. 
For specific training, please refer to the DNN paper.
